# MCAT Study Tracker

This is my personal study log and organizational hub for my MCAT prep journey.  
Target Test Date: **January 2026**  
Target Score: **515+**

## Structure
- 📅 `schedule/`: Weekly and review schedules
- 🧠 `notes/`: Content summaries and reference sheets
- ❌ `weaknesses/`: Mistakes and topics I need to reinforce
- 🧪 `practice/`: Practice exam performance, UWorld stats, CARS analysis
- 📓 `logs/`: Daily logs with progress, reflections, and goals
- 🛠 `tools/`: Templates and systems to keep me on track (e.g. 24/7/W)

## Study Philosophy
Consistency > Intensity  
Active Recall > Passive Review  
Track → Reflect → Refine
Time frame on when things should be reviewed as the following: 
24 hours within learning 
7 days after Pass #1 
Weakness Review at Least each weekend
