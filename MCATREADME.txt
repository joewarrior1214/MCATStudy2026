# MCAT Study Tracker

This is my personal study log and organizational hub for my MCAT prep journey.  
Target Test Date: **January 2026**  
Target Score: **515+**

## Structure
- 📅 `schedule/`: Weekly and review schedules
- 🧠 `notes/`: Content summaries and reference sheets
- ❌ `weaknesses/`: Mistakes and topics I need to reinforce
- 🧪 `practice/`: Practice exam performance, UWorld stats, CARS analysis
- 📓 `logs/`: Daily logs with progress, reflections, and goals
- 🛠 `tools/`: Templates and systems to keep me on track (e.g. 24/7/W)

## 📚 Study Philosophy

- **Consistency > Intensity**
- **Active Recall > Passive Review**
- **Track → Reflect → Refine**

### ⏱️ Spaced Review Protocol
All topics should be reviewed using this timeline:
- 🔁 **24 hours** within initial exposure
- 🔁 **7 days** after first pass
- 📆 **Weekly**: Focused review of weaknesses at least once per weekend
